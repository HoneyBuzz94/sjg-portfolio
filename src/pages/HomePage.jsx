            <p>Hi! My name is Sam, and I'm a fullstack web developer.</p>
            <p>
              I have a diverse professional background that has given me the
              opportunity to work with all kinds of people on all kinds of
              projects. From child care to residential care, from the military
              to state regulation and enforcement, and even from construction to
              coding. I've had many oppportunities to both be involved in and
              lead out on numerous projects. My goal with each project that I
              undertake is to increase productivity and (ultimately) make life
              easier for others. My passion lies in helping other people
              succeed!
